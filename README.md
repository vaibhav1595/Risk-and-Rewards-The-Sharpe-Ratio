In this project, I will apply the Sharpe ratio to real financial data using pandas to compare which investment one should go  for between **_Amazon_** and **_Facebook_**.

- Loaded, Visualized, and summarized daily stock price data for 'Amazon', 'Facebook' and 'S&P500'
- Calculated daily stock returns data for 'Amazon', 'Facebook' and 'S&P500'
- Performed calculations for 'Excess Returns: S&P 500 VS Stocks'
- Computed 'Mean' and 'Standard Deviations' for Excess Returns
- Determined 'Sharpe Ratio' to indicate how much more (or less) return the investment opportunity under consideration yields per unit of risk
